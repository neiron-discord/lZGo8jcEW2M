[00:03.67] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[00:06.62] Am I controversial? Not really…
[00:09.67] Hold on, why? You're overestimating me
[00:13.17] I can't say how I feel, my stomach churns
[00:16.42] I live an ordinary life, make ordinary mistakes
[00:19.50] To love each other is so nice, isn't it?
[00:22.88] The spotlight exposed shadows too
[00:26.08] I smile since I'm a coward, it's a defensive instinct
[00:29.29] They peek at me as they speak, criticize
[00:31.83] Doing what they want, saying what they want
[00:34.79] but thank you very much...!
[00:38.17] Ah
[00:38.96] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[00:41.75] Really? Really? That misconception's awesome (HEY!)
[00:45.29] "You have some problems." "You have some problems."
[00:48.08] That's hilarious, hilarious, so pure and cute (HEY!)
[00:51.54] A knife I never wanted, I was only holding it
[00:54.17] But over time, I strangely started to like it (Oh)
[00:58.04] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[01:00.88] It's sinking in, I could cry
[01:02.29] I'm sorry I'm just weak…

[01:11.25] Wah, wah, don't get mad everyone
[01:14.17] Wah, wah, have some tea
[01:17.29] Let's shake hands!
[01:18.25] No, I'm not being cocky
[01:20.04] Is this a ridiculous memorization game? To break me?
[01:23.21] I hate that kind of battle
[01:24.88] I won't surrender, yet
[01:26.29] Since warm words make me feel better
[01:30.12] In a universe that's full of bad ends
[01:33.33] I walk a tightrope even in virtual reality
[01:36.54] An absurd V.I.P
[01:39.12] Oh, umm, who are you again?
[01:42.29] I always enjoy working with you..!
[01:45.83] Ah
[01:47.54] I did it again
[01:49.12] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[01:51.96] I'm good, I'm evil, that preconception's awesome (HEY!)
[01:55.46] "Farewell, bye-bye," "Farewell, bye-bye"
[01:58.25] Is that so? Is that so? I guess to each his own (HEY!)
[02:01.71] I'm surrounded, on a bed of thorns
[02:05.12] But I'll make wherever I am my home (Oh)
[02:08.29] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[02:11.04] Not like this, not like that
[02:12.67] Sorry for drawing a defensive line…
[02:15.62] I'm not necessarily a good person
[02:20.62] But I'm not as awful a person as you think
[02:26.67] Probably
[02:27.79] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[02:34.12] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[02:36.79] Yes okay, yes okay, I'm… not as you expected!
[02:40.42] A knife I never wanted, I was only holding it
[02:43.04] But over time, I strangely started to like it (Oh)
[02:47.08] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[02:49.67] It's sinking in, I could cry
[02:51.33] I'm sorry I'm just weak…
[02:54.33] I couldn't meet your expectations, my bad ♡

[03:04.46] Am I controversial? Am I controversial?
[03:07.42] Am I controversial? What about you?
